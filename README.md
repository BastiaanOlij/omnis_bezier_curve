Importing library
-----------------
This is an Omnis Studio 8.1.x library exported in JSON format. Please use the JSON importer in Omnis Studio to import the project.

If you are purely interested in the logic, check out wBezierTest/makeBezierLine.omh and wBezierTest/positionBezierLine.omh
The code in these files should work in older versions of Omnis Studio as well.
